# 🤖 Machine Learning & Data Analysis - Instructor Portfolio

This repository contains the workshop materials, coding labs, and projects I delivered as a **Data Science Instructor** for the **MIT Emerging Talent** program.

### 🎯 Scope & Context
These materials cover the practical application of Machine Learning algorithms using Python.
* **Role:** Lead Instructor & Curriculum Developer
* **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
* **Key Topics:** Regression Analysis, Classification Models, Clustering, and Model Evaluation metrics.

### ⚠️ Instructor Note
This branch serves as my teaching portfolio. It includes:
1.  **Guided Labs:** Step-by-step notebooks I created to teach core ML concepts.
2.  **Solutions:** Reference implementations for student assignments.

Welcome to our ML workshop! This series is designed to give you **hands-on experience** with data analysis and machine learning using Python. You'll explore real datasets, write code in live sessions, and build models that reflect real-world problems.

---

## Workshop Format

Each session is structured for both learning and doing:

- **Lecture**: 20–30 minutes  
- **Break**: 10 minutes (in the middle)  
- **Live Coding**: Remainder of the session  

> **Everyone is expected to actively participate** during the coding part!

## Tools & Setup

We’ll be using **Google Colab** for live coding — no installation required!

🔗 You just need a **Google account** to access Colab notebooks.  
If you're offline or prefer local development, **Jupyter Notebook** works too.

### If using Jupyter locally, install:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
